# gptToAnki

This project aims to automatically create anki cards using the capabilities of llm. 
We achieve this by using the tool gpt4all for their indexing capabilities.
The goal is to upload all files provided by a class in your university index it using gpt4all and then querry a selected llm to create the anki cards.
After the result of the llm is parsed, the anki parser converts them into a anki-readable format.
